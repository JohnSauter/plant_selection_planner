## Description

Amateur gardeners often go to plant nurseries and ask for plants that meet certain criteria. It can be difficult to narrow down the immense number of choices at a nursery while meeting all desired criteria. If a gardener were able to search a list of plants by desired criteria and develop a list of plants that meet their needs, they could take their list to a nursery and ask if their desired plants are available, rather than asking the nursery to narrow their choices down for them, expediting the process for everyone.
