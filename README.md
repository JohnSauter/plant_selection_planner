## Description

Amateur gardeners often go to plant nurseries and ask for plants that meet 
certain criteria. It can be difficult to narrow down the immense number 
of choices at a nursery while meeting all desired criteria. 
If a gardener were able to search a list of plants by desired criteria 
and develop a list of plants that meet their needs, 
they could take their list to a nursery and ask if their desired plants 
are available, rather than asking the nursery to narrow their choices down 
for them, expediting the process for everyone.
